'''
This script reads PGN games directly from command line arguments, and mass-queues whatever it sees in parallel.

PGN games can be pasted into a single argument by using bash's multiline string quoting syntax:

$'this is
a multiline
single arg'

(see e.g. https://stackoverflow.com/a/25941527/1497645)

This is useful for e.g. pasting TCEC PVs (players or kibitzers) for queueing. One can paste the game moves, two players'
PV pgn and two kibitzers' PV pgn, for a total of 5 arguments to this script, which will all be queued in parallel (less
than a second for hundreds of positions). In other words, live TCEC data can be queued into CDB just as fast as you can
copy and paste it. (To queue from files, see queue_pgn_files.py.)
