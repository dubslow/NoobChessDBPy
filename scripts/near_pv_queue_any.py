'''
iterate over CDB near PVs, using a "queue any" visitor to `queue` everything seen.
Users are of course encouraged to customize the visitor or the formatting to file as they please.

Run this command for more details about the walking:
`python -c "from noobchessdbpy.library import AsyncCDBLibrary; help(AsyncCDBLibrary.iterate_near_pv)"`

Note: fortresses quickly cause search explosions. Changing the margin by a single cp may cause the iterator to hit a
fortress, or indeed the same margin used multiple times in a row may cause the (near-)PV to shift towards one (or away
from one).

------------------------------------------------------

Here, "fortress" means "a position where many moves are all nearly equally best", which causes intense branching and
combinatorial explosion.

Common warning signs for fortresses, loosely in order of utility:
1) when `todo` increases as fast as `nodes` does
2) when `dups` increases as fast as `todo` does (more transpositions than novel nodes)
3) when `todo` approaches the same magnitude as `nodes`
4) when `dups` approaches the magnitude of `nodes`
5) when `relply` remains depressed lower than in previous similar runs
6) when a position has more than 6-8 moves already known (least useful)

TODO: add maxply, fortress-detecting options
