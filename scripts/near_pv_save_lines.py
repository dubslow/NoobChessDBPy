'''
iterate over CDB near PVs, using a "save leaves" visitor to record results of all non-branching nodes. Then for each
leaf, print the entire move history used to reach that leaf from the root.

Users are of course encouraged to customize the visitor or the formatting to file as they please.

Run this command for more details about the walking:
`python -c "from noobchessdbpy.library import AsyncCDBLibrary; help(AsyncCDBLibrary.iterate_near_pv)"`

Note: fortresses quickly cause search explosions. Changing the margin by a single cp may cause the iterator to hit a
fortress, or indeed the same margin used multiple times in a row may cause the (near-)PV to shift towards one (or away
from one).

------------------------------------------------------

Here, "fortress" means "a position where many moves are all nearly equally best", which causes intense branching and
combinatorial explosion.

Common warning signs for fortresses, loosely in order of utility:
1) when `todo` increases as fast as `nodes` does
2) when `dups` increases as fast as `todo` does (more transpositions than novel nodes)
3) when `todo` approaches the same magnitude as `nodes`
4) when `dups` approaches the magnitude of `nodes`
5) when `relply` remains depressed lower than in previous similar runs
6) when a position has more than 6-8 moves already known (least useful)

TODO: add maxply, fortress-detecting options
