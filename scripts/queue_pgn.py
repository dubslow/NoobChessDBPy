'''
This script reads PGN files, one at a time: read games from one file into memory, find all positions in the games
(including variations and PVs stored in comments), deduplicate the positions, rinse and repeat, and cross-deduplicate
between all files. Then mass-queue the cross-deduplicated positions into CDB.
(Note: queueing near-root positions can be quite expensive, so use this with caution. TODO: write a better form that
does only some queueing, and some querying instead)
Note: queue order is arbitrary.

(One can also queue lines by pasting PGN directly on the command line, see queue_lines.py)
