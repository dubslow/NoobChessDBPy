'''
Query positions in breadth first order, subject to a filter, and write the positions to file.

By default this script has `well_biased_filter`, which searches for knife-edge positions with at least two viable
noncapture moves.

Of course the user may write any other filter they desire.

The output isn't immediately suitable for book building: no checks are done for transpostions or multiple hits in a
single PV or similar. Such variety checks should be applied before making a book proper.
