'''
Query positions in breadth first order, filter them by an arbitrary predicate, and write the accepted positions to file.

This "simple" version uses a batching process: query a batch of positions, then filter the batch, then query another
batch, etc, until the given limits are reached. (One or more limit arguments are required, see below.)

As a baseline, this script includes a default, example filter called `well_biased_filter`. `well_biased_filter` accepts
knife-edge positions with at least two viable moves.

Of course the user may write any other filter they desire. Many more advanced filters are possible based on CDB's
query-response data.

Be warned that the output isn't immediately suitable for book building: no checks are done for transpostions or multiple
hits in a single PV or similar. Such variety checks should be applied before making a book proper.

Being a "brute force" breadth-first iterator, the positions produced will have been reached by blunders, on average --
but blunders that average out to passing the filter.

Finally, for root positions other than the startpos, CDB is likely to not know most of these blundering positions.
Therefore, running a non-startpos query twice, the second a day after the first, is likely to produce more filtered
positions, after the CDB elves have processed the formerly-unknown blunder positions.
