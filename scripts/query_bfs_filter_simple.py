'''
Query positions in breadth first order, subject to a filter, and write the positions to file.
This can of course easily be expanded to do whatever more analysis the user likes on the positions.
Configure the defaults by modifying the all capital globals below.

Note that no checking for transpositions or one good pos being the child of another is done. Users
shouldn't directly construct a book from this, but should do further filtering for variety.
