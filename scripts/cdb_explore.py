iterate over CDB near PVs, using the default visitor to `queue` everything walked.

Note: fortresses quickly cause search explosions. Changing the margin by a single cp may cause the iterator to hit a
fortress, or indeed the same margin used multiple times in a row may cause the (near-)PV to shift towards one (or away
from one).

Here, "fortress" means "a position where many moves are all nearly equally best", which causes intense branching and
combinatorial explosion.

Common warning signs for fortresses, loosely in order of utility:
1) when `todo` increases as fast as `nodes` does
2) when `dups` increases as fast as `todo` does (more transpositions than novel nodes)
3) when `todo` approaches the same magnitude as `nodes`
4) when `dups` approaches the magnitude of `nodes`
5) when `relply` remains depressed lower than in previous similar runs
6) when a position has more than 6-8 moves already known (least useful)

TODO: add maxbranch, maxply, margindecay options
