# some notes:
# 'queue', request for analysis, does a refresh of all child nodes, with recursive deep refresh of pv-lines thereof, minimum depth 20(ish) ply max 100 ply
# whereas 'query' does only a shallow child refresh, a ply or two.
# (exception: when too little material on the board, ....???)
# additionally, for classical only, a background process tries its best to ensure all positions are connected to the
# startpos in some way, every few days or so
# 'store' effectively creates a new child node, however directly 'queue'ing the child node position will automatically link that child to its parent.

# query retval is json with keys "moves", "ply", "status", moves is list, each move has "note", "rank", "san", "score", "uci", "winrate"
# moves: "rank" is similar to the notation in "notes", 2=best, 1=good, 0=worse, but may show 0 for all moves in a bad pos
#        "notes" is as on the web interface, counting child nodes and annotating the move
# ply: the shortest path from the rootpos to the classical startpos
