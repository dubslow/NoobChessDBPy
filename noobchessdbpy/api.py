'''
The python wrapper to the CDB API. In general, create an AsyncCDBClient instance, and use its methods to make API calls.
This class inherits from httpx.AsyncClient, and forwards kwargs thereto.

API call return values are generally json (i.e. a python dict) or a CDBStatus value.

Also exposed here are `CDBStatus`, an enum reflecting the status of a single API response, and `CDBError`, which is a
generic `Exception` for when those statuses are bad.

See also the docstrings of these objects.

# some notes:
# 'queue', request for analysis, does a refresh of all child nodes, with recursive deep refresh of pv-lines thereof, minimum depth 20(ish) ply max 100 ply
# whereas 'query' does only a shallow child refresh, a ply or two.
# (exception: when too little material on the board, ....???)
# additionally, for classical only, a background process tries its best to ensure all positions are connected to the
# startpos in some way, every few days or so
# 'store' effectively creates a new child node, however directly 'queue'ing the child node position will automatically link that child to its parent.

# query retval is json with keys "moves", "ply", "status", moves is list, each move has "note", "rank", "san", "score", "uci", "winrate"
# moves: "rank" is similar to the notation in "notes", 2=best, 1=good, 0=worse, but may show 0 for all moves in a bad pos
#        "notes" is as on the web interface, counting child nodes and annotating the move
# ply: the shortest path from the rootpos to the classical startpos

# current testing indicates max rate of ~400-500 req/s, with no added rate above concurrency=256, on my cpu at least
# currently unknown what is the bottleneck. maybe chess.Board.fen()?
