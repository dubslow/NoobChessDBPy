This module implements some standard CDB interaction algorithms, building atop the API.

Since we want to keep reusing one http client, the algorithms are all implemented as methods on a further subclass of the
API client: `AsyncCDBLibrary`. Create an instance of this class to use the algorithms.

Arguments are generally `chess` objects.
